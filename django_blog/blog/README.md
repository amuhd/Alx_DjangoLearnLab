Blog Post CRUD Operations
This Django blog application supports the following CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for blog posts:

Create: Authenticated users can create new blog posts using the post creation form.
Read: All users, whether authenticated or not, can view the list of blog posts and detailed views of individual posts.
Update: Only the post author can edit their blog posts.
Delete: Only the post author can delete their blog posts.
Permissions with Django Mixins
Permissions for blog posts are enforced using Djangoâ€™s LoginRequiredMixin and UserPassesTestMixin:

LoginRequiredMixin: Ensures that only authenticated users can create, edit, or delete posts.
UserPassesTestMixin: Restricts access to the update and delete views so that only the author of the post can modify or remove their content.
